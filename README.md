# TauPropagationModel

## Abstract
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is an extremely prevalent neurodegenerative disorder which causes progressive cognitive decline. AD is a tau protein pathology, which starts in the transentorhinal cortex and progresses to other limbic and cortical areas. Tau can spread between neurons via synaptic transmission, so leading therapeutics target its pathological isoforms and inhibit their uptake into adjacent cells. We developed a tau propagation model based on neural firing rates that simulates protein removal as the result of therapeutic intervention and describes its net effects on a neural network. Using this model, we measured tau prevalence and cell death over time. Our data suggest that the most effective therapeutic solutions must affect 95% of infected cells and reduce their tau spreading activity by 85% in order to maintain a 99% neural survival rate. For a quick and efficient alternative to running the full simulation, we trained a polynomial support vector machine learning algorithm (SVM) to classify a drug’s efficacy given its parameter values. Through statistical analysis, we also concluded that targeting a greater tau population is more important than the tau reduction factor for impairing its spread for the most effective therapeutics. Such findings may have the potential to guide the development and administration of therapeutics.
